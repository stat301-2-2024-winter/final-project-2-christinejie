:::

an analysis plan: data splitting, resampling (cross-validation, bootstrap, etc), which model types, how many recipes, etc. Note that students should have this mapped out in their GitHub repo. That is, there should be place holder R scripts created. You don't have to have everything coded, but the overall structure should be evident.   
Two model types should be defined and fitted to the resamples: null/baseline model and one other model type (likely standard linear or logistic model):
The recipe can be very basic since we just want to see if you can get things running
Students should summarize their progress, where they are at, and what their next steps will be. Identifying and potential issues or concerns would be a good idea too.
